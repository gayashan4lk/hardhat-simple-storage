# FreeCodeCamp Youtube Tutorial (Lesson 6) : Hardhat Simple Storage

[Full Blockchain Solidity Course JS (Lesson 6)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-6-hardhat-simple-storage)

## Setup

Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/gayashan4lk/hardhat-simple-storage
cd hardhat-simple-storage
```

Then install dependencies

```
yarn
```

> Note: You'll notice in our `package.json` we are using `"solc": "0.8.7-fixed"`. Usually, you'll just be able to do `"solc": "0.8.7"` to get a specific version, but there was a bit of an issue with that one... You'll find out why we use 0.8.7

## Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
